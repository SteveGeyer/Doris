# Sketches

This directory holds Arduino code.


[v2/balance](https://github.com/SteveGeyer/Doris/tree/master/sketches/v2/balance) is the first version of the code I got working. This version uses the Arduino Leonardo's two 16-bit timers to generate the necessary stepper pulses. That works great for a two-wheel segway-style balancer, but it won't work for a three-motor ballbot. The Leonardo ony has two 16-bit timers. So I will need to find a different approach to drive the stepper motor.

[v2/nointerrupts](https://github.com/SteveGeyer/Doris/tree/master/sketches/v2/nointerrupts) does not use the 16-bit timer interrupts at all. Instead it steps each motor by polling against the elasped time and then pulsing the stepper. This code seems to balance well as well as the original code, but the stepper motors give off a more musical sounds. I have no idea why they sound different.

[v3/nointerrupts](https://github.com/SteveGeyer/Doris/tree/master/sketches/v3/nointerrupts) is the same code as the V2 version modified to use an Arduino Uno and the custom PC board's I/O pin layout. I have noticed a little instablity in the V3 balance. I will be working to resolve this.

[MPU6050_calibration](https://github.com/SteveGeyer/Doris/tree/master/sketches/MPU6050_calibration) is the sketch used to dervive the calibration parameters for the MPU6050. These parameters and currently wired into the code. This sketch was written by Luis RÃ³denas <luisrodenaslorda@gmail.com>.
